[AdventOfCode 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
AdventOfCode is a yearly event for which a new, two-part, coding challenge is released each day of December until the 25th.

I have struggled to find the time to do the previous two years, and with a busy december ahead I don't expect to get much more time this year.
That being said I am going to make an effort to make time to do the problems in python at least.

If I find myself with the time available, or perhaps in the new year, I will also attempt to produce solutions in Rust.
As always, I will try to make my python solutions readable, maintainable and efficient.
I am (completely) new to rust, so any solutions I implement in Rust are likely to be "odd" as I try to expose myself to as much of the language as possible.

In the ReadMe.md file for each day you will find the problems themselves,
along with some notes on my solutions.

Here is the current status of my solutions:

| Day | Star | Solved in Python | Solved in Rust |
| --- | ---- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 01 | 01 | No | No |

Some python solutions will import modules from my aoc_tools package, you will need to install this using:
```pip install aoc-tools-dannyboywoop```

(Or you can install the dependencies with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)).
